# GetContactsApp
This is a simple Android app which fetches API data from a URI using AsyncTask, Volley, OKHttp, and Retrofit respectively.
The concept of Services will also be applied.
Different network api call can be found in different branches.
In latter part of the stage, I would also apply gridView, reclyerView and staggeredView in the project
